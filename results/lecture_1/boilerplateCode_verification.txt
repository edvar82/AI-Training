1) Rating: 9/10

2) Evaluation: The OUTPUT generates a Python class that includes the required attributes and methods based on the class description provided. However, it lacks docstrings and type hints for the class attributes and methods, which were explicitly requested in the TASK requirements. Including these elements would enhance clarity and usability of the generated code.
